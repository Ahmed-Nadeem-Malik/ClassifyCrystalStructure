# AI Crystal Structure Classification

This project uses artificial intelligence to classify crystal structures on an arbitrary scale. It started as a personal learning endeavor after attending several ML workshops hosted by the society. Inspired by an internship focused on classifying nano-crystal structures, I decided to build a mini version of the project to deepen my understanding of both crystal classification and the underlying data acquisition methods. Note that the main challenge of this project is the inability to obtain real experimental data.

VERY GOOD IDEA TO JUST RUN IT IN GITHUB CODEBASES IT IS JUST MORE SIMPLE

## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib tensorflow

2.Run main.py

let me know if there can be any improvents, just want to learn :)
