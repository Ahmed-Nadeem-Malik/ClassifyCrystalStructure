# AI Crystal Strucuture classification
Classifies crystal structures using AI. The number correlates to a arbitary scale
This project started with me learning a lot about ML in some AI workshops run by the society. Then I saw an internship that interested me about classifying nano crystal structures. I thought, why not try to make a mini version? So, I learned a lot about how crystals are classified and how they get the data. The main problem with this project is that i literally cant obtain experimental data anywhere.

How to run:

```bash
  pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib tensorflow

```bash
  run the file

Any issue let me know, or any way to improve either, just want to learn :)
